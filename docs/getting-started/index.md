## Overview

Mamba Agents is a thin wrapper around [pydantic-ai](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) that adds enterprise-grade infrastructure:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Context Management** | Automatic message tracking with 5 compaction strategies |
| **Token Tracking** | Built-in usage and cost estimation |
| **Workflows** | Orchestration patterns like ReAct for multi-step tasks |
| **MCP Integration** | Connect to Model Context Protocol servers |
| **Observability** | Structured logging, tracing, and OpenTelemetry |
| **Error Handling** | Retry logic and circuit breaker patterns |

The simplest way to start is:

```python
from mamba_agents import Agent

agent = Agent("gpt-4o")
result = agent.run_sync("Hello!")
print(result.output)
```
