class ReActConfig(WorkflowConfig):
    """Configuration for ReAct workflow execution.

    Extends WorkflowConfig with ReAct-specific settings for reasoning
    trace visibility, termination strategy, and context management.

    Attributes:
        expose_reasoning: Whether Thought steps appear in workflow state.
        reasoning_prefix: Prefix for reasoning/thought in prompts.
        action_prefix: Prefix for actions in prompts.
        observation_prefix: Prefix for observations in prompts.
        termination_strategy: How to detect workflow completion ("tool" only for MVP).
        final_answer_tool_name: Name of the tool that signals completion.
        auto_compact_in_workflow: Whether to auto-compact context mid-workflow.
        compact_threshold_ratio: Ratio of context limit to trigger compaction.
        max_consecutive_thoughts: Max thoughts without action before forcing action.
        include_scratchpad: Whether to include full reasoning history in each iteration.
        tool_retry_count: Number of retries for failed tool calls.

    Example:
        >>> config = ReActConfig(
        ...     max_iterations=15,
        ...     expose_reasoning=True,
        ...     termination_strategy="tool",
