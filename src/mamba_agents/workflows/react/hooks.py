    Inherits the 8 base workflow hooks and adds 4 ReAct-specific hooks:
    - on_thought: Called when a reasoning trace is generated.
    - on_action: Called when a tool is about to be executed.
    - on_observation: Called when a tool result is received.
    - on_compaction: Called when context is compacted.

    All hooks can be sync or async functions.

        ...     print(f"Thought: {thought}")
